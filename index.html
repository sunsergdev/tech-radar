        <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
        <p>
          The DotMyStyle Tech Radar is a curated collection of technologies,
          each accompanied by an evaluation known as a
          <em>"ring assignment"</em>. We utilize four distinct rings, each with
          its own specific meaning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; These are technologies that we have
            immense confidence in to fulfill our objectives, even at a large
            scale. They have a well-established usage culture within our
            production environment, pose low risks, and are strongly recommended
            for widespread adoption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; These are technologies that have
            demonstrated success in solving real-world problems during project
            work. They represent our initial experiences confirming their
            benefits and uncovering potential limitations. TRIAL technologies
            are somewhat riskier, as they are still in the early stages of our
            organization's adoption. Engineers who have ventured into this
            territory will share their knowledge and insights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; These technologies show promise and
            offer clear potential value to us. They are worth investing in
            research and prototyping efforts to determine their impact. ASSESS
            technologies come with higher risks, as they are often brand new and
            largely untested within our organization. You can find engineers
            with expertise in these technologies who advocate for them, and some
            teams might have initiated prototyping projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies in this category are not
            recommended for new projects. We believe they are not yet worth
            further investment. While they may not be suitable for new
            endeavors, existing projects can continue using HOLD technologies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

        <p>
          The Tech Radar serves as a valuable resource for inspiring and
          assisting engineering teams within DotMyStyle in selecting the most
          suitable technologies for their new projects. It offers a platform for
          sharing knowledge and experience related to technologies, as well as
          for contemplating technology choices, thereby fostering the continuous
          development of our technology landscape. Drawing inspiration from the
          pioneering efforts of ThoughtWorks, our Tech Radar delineates
          noteworthy shifts in software development technologies—changes that we
          believe our engineering teams should be attentive to and incorporate
          into their projects. You can find more information about it
          <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">here</a>.

        <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

        <p>
          Our <em>Engineers</em> manages this Tech Radar for driving and helping
          in decision making around technology. Each technology is discussed and
          voted upon before assigning to a ring. This helps our engineers avoid
          any pitfalls, sharing learned lessons and contribute to good practices
          on using the technologies.
